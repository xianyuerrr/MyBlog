# Python之禅

```python
>>> import this
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
```



1. 优美胜于丑陋（以优美为目标）

2. 明了胜于晦涩

3. 简洁胜于复杂（尽量不要有复杂的内部实现）

4. 复杂胜于凌乱（就算复杂是不可避免的，也要保证代码之间没有难懂的关系）

5. 扁平胜于嵌套（不要有太多嵌套）

6. 间隔胜于紧凑（不要写的太挤）

7. 可读性很重要

8. 这些规则不可违背

9. 不要无故忽视异常（不写 expect: pass 风格的代码，除非你确定要这样）

10. 做之前要先思考，立刻着手好过永远不做。然而，永远不做也好过闷头蛮干

11. 方案思路要清晰，倘若你的实现很难解释，它**一定不是**个好主意。倘若你的实现一目了然，它**可能是**个好主意。

12. 命名空间大法好，同志们要多多搞。
